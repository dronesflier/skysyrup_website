# The sky plays bright and the hill speaks down to you.
# What can you do?
# You don't know.
# You can't know.

# The waterfall cuts through stone so deep,
# with ancient voice that makes you weep,
# spilling secrets foam-white and gleaming
# that fade away like fading dreaming.

# It knows the weight of water's call,
# the force that pulls and claims us all.
# You stand where understanding bends,
# and listen as the water sends

# what the hill could never say,
# what the bright sky hides away
# in endless blue that dances wild
# above you like a restless child.

# The mist rises like your breath,
# like words you'll seek until your death
# for this moment caught between
# the known and all you've never seen.
