                i am ashley! I do lots of things, i do silly things, i do less silly things.<br><br>
                i work at a local small company that does websites for a couple of (semi-)local businesses. technically, I know PHP. but heyy! that's just a theory. :D In all seriousness, I do spend a lot of time on the internet, and I hope I can share some of it, along with my general thoughts, with you!<br>
                <br>
                i have a multitude of hobbies, and I try to keep up with them ..mostly. I spend a lot of time with computers, obviously, both in a software and somewhat hardware sense. furthermore, I spend lots of time playing video games, specifically RPGs like Undertale, DELTARUNE, and so on. Vocaloid is also a big part of my musical sense. I also play the piano, and try to compose music every so often.<br>
                <br>
                also, I consume too much political content! specifically, I try to involve myself in local politics, because it really helps my ability to stay focused and not get lost in online circlejerks. to that extent, I'm part of BÜNDNIS 90/ Die Grünen, which has let me meet some really amazing people and actually do something. I really recommend you to get involved in local politics, even if it's just a small group of people. it really helps you stay grounded and not get ...lost in the online world.<br>
                <br>
                I HAVE CATS!! THREE OF THEM, actually! cats are the bestest thing in this world and they <i>deserve</i> it as well.<br>
                <br>
                to, um, talk about the elephant in the room, uh; yea this site runs off my new nintendo 3ds XL :3. it's about a 1mbps connection, multiple times weaker than a raspberry pi, runs through two proxies. i thought it would be funny. i still think it is. you can see some live info about the server in the sidebar. <br>
                That is to say, if you scrape this site aggressively, i will be very sad.
